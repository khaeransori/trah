## What we are looking for

We are looking for contributions that improve the project's code, documentation, or other forms of contributions that benefit the project.

## Getting Started

Before you begin:
- Ensure you have installed all prerequisites mentioned in the [README.md](README.md).
- Check out the existing issues and see if you can help with any of them.
- Ensure your suggestion is not already listed, or that a similar pull request was not recently accepted or rejected.

## Reporting Bugs

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/khaeransori/trah/issues). To report a bug, follow these steps:
1. Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
2. Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible.
3. Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.

## Feature Requests

This section guides you through submitting a feature request:
1. Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.
2. Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.
3. Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most Trah users.

## Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:
- Maintain Trah's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible Trah

Here are a couple of pointers for opening a good pull request:
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

Include as much information as possible about the PR; this context helps the reviewer understand and test your code better.

## Style Guides
### Git Commit Messages
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### JavaScript Styleguide
- Use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to check your JavaScript code.
